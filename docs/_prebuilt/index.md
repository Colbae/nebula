## 🌌 About NEBULA

**NEBULA** is a cutting-edge platform designed to facilitate the
training of federated models within both centralized and decentralized
architectures. It streamlines the development, deployment, and
management of federated applications across physical and virtualized
devices.

## 🚀 Key Components

NEBULA boasts a **modular architecture** that consists of three core
elements:

-   **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for setting up experiments
    and monitoring progress.
-   **Controller**: An orchestrator that ensures efficient operation
    management.
-   **Core**: The fundamental component deployed on each device to
    handle federated learning processes.

## 🌟 Main Features

-   **Decentralized**: Train models without a central server, leveraging
    decentralized federated learning.
-   **Privacy-preserving**: Maintain data privacy by training on-device
    and only sharing model updates.
-   **Topology-agnostic**: Support for various network topologies
    including star, ring, and mesh.
-   **Model-agnostic**: Compatible with a wide range of machine learning
    algorithms, from deep learning to traditional methods.
-   **Network communication**: Secure and efficient device communication
    with features like compression, network failure tolerance, and
    condition simulation.
-   **Real-time monitoring**: Provides live performance metrics and
    visualizations during the learning process.

## 🌍 Scenario Applications

-   **Healthcare**: Train models on medical devices such as wearables,
    smartphones, and sensors.
-   **Industry 4.0**: Implement on industrial devices like robots,
    drones, and constrained devices.
-   **Mobile services**: Optimize for mobile devices including
    smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
-   **Military**: Apply to military equipment such as drones, robots,
    and sensors.
-   **Vehicular scenarios**: Utilize in vehicles including cars, trucks,
    and drones.
